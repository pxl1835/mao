      1. Parent - Child html element relationship:
         a. A parent element groups its child(ren) element(s) 
             example: 
                The "container" <div>(id="container") below
                groups the 
                  <div id="header" ...>Drag here to move</div>
                  <h1 ...>Draggable Parent-Child/Layered Elements Demo</h1>
                which(<div> + <h1>) intuitively move along as a group with the "container" <div> 
                when the "header" <div> is dragged. 
                The moving action is done by the javascript on the "container" <div>.
         b. A child element is in front of its parent element by default, not physically part of
            its parent,  which can be thought of as 
               'the child element devides/blocks/is inside of its parent'. 
               example:
                  If the "container" <div> is a part of the <body> element physically,
                  after moving away the "container" <div> from a spot, it would leave
                  the <body> element a blank/hole where the "container" <div> was,
                  evidently we do not observe the mentioned phenomenon, 
                  so concluded that the "container" <div> 
                  must be in front of the <body>, not part of the <body> element.

      2.  Some CSS usages. Please see the comments in the <style></style> element below.
      3.  The use of javascript in the <script></script> element to achive dynamic or real time functionalities.

       1.  Review 1.b above
       2.  Demo 1.a above
            a. width %
            b. show/hide
            c. move   
       3.  css display inline-block vs flex
